# EffPPL

We present EffPPL, a shallowly embedded domain-specific probabilistic programming library in Multicore OCaml made using effect handlers. EffPPL has the capability to perform approximate Bayesian inference for models using continuous random variables. EffPPL uses the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for performing the inference.
